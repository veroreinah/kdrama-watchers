# Kdrama watchers

The goal of this project is to have a place where I can sort out different kdramas I've watched or want to watch.

It uses [Wiki Drama](https://drama.fandom.com/es/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal) data to search kdramas. Once I've found the kdrama I'm looking for, I can add it to different lists (wishlist, currently watching, already watched or abandoned). and I can also perform different actions:

- Move a kdrama from one list to another or delete it.
- Edit the start and end (watching) dates of each kdrama.
- Change the rating of a kdrama.

The project is developed using **Vue**. It uses **Axios** to get data from [Wiki Drama](https://drama.fandom.com/es/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal) and **Firebase Firestore Database** to store selected kdramas.
